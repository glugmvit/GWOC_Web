## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Run the app in developer mode
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload as you make edits.

3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
    
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Make sure your code is formatted. Use
    ```
    npm run prettier
    ```
    incase prettier fails, use
    ```
    npm run prettier:fix
    ```

7. Issue that pull request!
